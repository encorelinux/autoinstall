# Autoinstallation Scripts for a fresh Arch Linux System
These are the scripts I use for installing the software and programs I need. They are specific designed for my needs. Feel free to adjust them as you see fit for your system. They take a lot of work off of you and give you a full system in no time.<br><br>
## Requirements
- Fresh Arch Linux installation
- Intel/AMD Microcodes <i>(sudo pacman -S intel-ucode)</i>
- Linux Headers <i>(sudo pacman -S linux-headers)</i>
- base-devel <i>(sudo pacman -S base-devel)</i>
