# Autoinstallation Scripts for a fresh Arch Linux System
These are the scripts I use for installing the software and programs I need. They are specific designed for my needs. Feel free to adjust them as you see fit for your system. They take a lot of work off of you and give you a full system in no time.<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> This scripts are tailored to my system. I am using Nvidia GPU and therefore installing proprietary Nvidia drivers. You have to adjust the script for your system before you run it!
## Requirements
- Fresh Arch Linux installation
- base-devel
- git
