# Autoinstallation Scripts for a fresh Arch Linux System
These are the scripts I use for installing the software and programs I need. They are specific designed for my needs. Feel free to adjust them as you see fit for your system. They take a lot of work off of you and give you a full system in no time.
## Requirements
- Fresh Arch Linux installation
- base-devel
- git
