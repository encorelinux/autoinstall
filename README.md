# Autoinstallation Scripts for a fresh Arch Linux System
These are the scripts I use for installing the software and programs I need. They are specific designed for my needs. Feel free to adjust them as you see fit for your system. They take a lot of work off of you and give you a full system in no time.<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> This scripts are tailored to my system. I am using Nvidia GPU and therefore installing proprietary Nvidia drivers. You have to adjust the script for your system before you run it!
## Requirements
- Fresh Arch Linux installation
- Intel/AMD Microcodes <i>(sudo pacman -S intel-ucode)</i>
- Linux Headers <i>(sudo pacman -S linux-headers)</i>
- base-devel <i>(sudo pacman -S base-devel)</i>

- GPU Drivers (if necessary)
